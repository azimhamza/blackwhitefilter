# Focus Tree Browser Extension

A productivity browser extension that combines website blocking with gamified focus sessions. Block distracting websites with a grayscale filter and grow a beautiful animated tree during focus sessions!

## Features

### üåê Website Filter
- **Grayscale Filter**: Automatically applies a black and white filter to specified websites to make them boring and less distracting
- **Easy Management**: Simple interface to add and remove websites from your block list
- **Smart Matching**: Automatically handles www prefixes and subdomains

### üå± Focus Tree Timer
- **Animated Tree Growth**: Watch a beautiful tree grow as you stay focused during timed sessions
- **Gamified Focus**: Set custom timer durations (minutes and seconds) for your focus sessions
- **Visual Feedback**: See your progress with real-time timer display and tree animations
- **Consequence System**: If you give up or visit blocked sites, your tree dies with a dramatic animation
- **Overlay Blocking**: When you visit blocked sites during active sessions, see a full-screen overlay with:
  - Live timer countdown
  - Animated growing tree
  - Option to give up (and kill the tree)
  - Motivational messaging

## How It Works

1. **Set Up Blocked Sites**: Use the "Website Filter" tab to add distracting websites
2. **Start Focus Session**: Switch to "Focus Tree" tab, set your desired time, and click "Start Focus"
3. **Watch Your Tree Grow**: The tree begins growing with beautiful animations
4. **Stay Focused**: If you visit blocked sites, you'll see the overlay with your progress
5. **Complete or Give Up**: Either complete the session successfully or give up (killing your tree)
